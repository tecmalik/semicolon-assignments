write a program that reverse an array 
pseudocode stage 1
initialize an array of integers  
initialize and create a new array of the same length/ size 
store as reverse 
iterate through the index starting from behind storing index on the integers in the new reverse index 
display reverse 

stage 2

initialize the array of numbers 
declare as array of integers = [34, 54, 65, 3, 33, 12, 15, 23]
initialize an array to hold reverse array 
declare reverse as array of array of integer with since equal to the length of integer 
iterate to reverse the array  
for index from 0 to length of integer 
	reverse[index] = integers[length of integers - 1 -integers 
display array 
print "The reverse from to length of reverse 
 print display
