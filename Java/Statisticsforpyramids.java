The largest Egyptian pyramid in the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is 449 feet tall and 756 feet long on each side. At the time it was constructed the pyramid was 481 feet high, but over time the pyramid lost 31 feet from the top.8 Jul 2023 
Herodotus states that gangs of 100,000 labourers worked on the building in three-month shifts, taking 20 years to build.
Each stone block within the pyramid weighs approximately 2267.96 kilograms (2.5 tons). Therefore the total weight of the great pyramid of Khufu is approximately: 2,300,000 x 2267.96 = 5,216,308,000 kilograms (5,750,000 tons).12 Aug 2023
